  Loveable AI- This was used to see all the interfaces you see when running the app. The entire creative aspect of the app was created via LoveableAI
  ChatGPT- I used ChatGPT when taking the app from loveable to github and then into my VSCode as it assisted me with what the necessary things I needed installed on VSCode along with setting up the environment and the steps in which to get there.


4. INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO RUN!! (VERRYYYY IMPORTANTTTTTT)
   -------------------------------------------------------
   -------------------------------------------------------
   As of right now the app can only be ran via localhost on the web as the transition to setting up a mobile emulator is still in the works. In order to run the app in Localhost please run the following commands in your VSCode/IDE Terminal

   1. npm install
   2. npm run dev

   After those are ran the terminal should provide prompting on how to access the app via a localhost link which you can click on or copy and a network one. (USE LOCALHOST)
   
5. YOU'RE DONE!
